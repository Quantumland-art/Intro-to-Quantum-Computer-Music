Before starting, make sure you have [Max](http://cycling74.com) installed, as well as [The QAC toolkit](http://quantumland.art/qac) Max package. You will also need an account with [IBM Quantum Experience](quantum-computing.ibm.com).

Clone this repo or download the [release zip](https://github.com/iccmr-quantum/Intro-to-Quantum-Computer-Music/releases/download/v1.0.0/Intro-to-Quantum-Computer-Music_.v1.0.0.zip). (Note: if you use the _Download zip_ function in github's green button at the top, it will not include the [UDP_Qasm submodule](/part_2/), and you'll have to manually [download it](https://github.com/iccmr-quantum/OSC-Qasm/archive/a6850fac656b44a59e0f26253627b736c959f8a4.zip) yourself)
