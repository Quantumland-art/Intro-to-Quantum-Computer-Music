# Intro to Quantum Computer Music
Learning IBM Quantum Experience, Max, _The QAC Toolkit_, and more.

## Installation
Before starting, make sure you have [Max](http://cycling74.com) installed, as well as [The QAC toolkit](http://quantumland.art/qac) Max package. You will also need an account with [IBM Quantum Experience](quantum-computing.ibm.com).

Clone this repo. (Note: if you use the zip download function in github it will not include the [UDP_Qasm submodule](/part_2/), and you'll have to manually [download it](https://github.com/iccmr-quantum/OSC-Qasm/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) yourself)

You're now ready to explore _Intro to Quantum Computer Music_!
