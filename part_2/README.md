# IQCM pt2

- [UDP_Qasm](https://github.com/iccmr-quantum/OSC-Qasm)
  - Note: This is now OSC_Qasm. At the time of IQCM pt 2, OSC_Qasm was known as UDP_Qasm. These are in fact 2 different versions that may not talk to each other. For completion, UDP_Qasm was included in this repo as a git submodule refering to the point in time where it was still UDP_Qasm. This will allow you to follow the tutorial as it was taught during [1st ISQCMC](https://go.och.pw/isqcmc).
